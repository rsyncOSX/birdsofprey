The Short-eared owl nests in the mountainous regions and migrates to the southern hemisphere during the winter months.

All three owl species are widespread and common. However, despite their ubiquity, they can be challenging to observe. While all three species engage in diurnal hunting, the Short-eared owl and Long-eared owl are most active during sunrise and sunset. The Northern hawk-owl and Short-eared owl have yellow eyes, whereas the Long-eared owl has orange eyes.

During the spring season, the Short-eared owl migrates to the mountainous regions. During this migration, I have had the privilege of observing it in close proximity to my residence in Southern Norway. In 2025, I also had the opportunity to witness the Short-eared owl perched near my cabin within the mountains approximately five to six times. On occasion, I have observed it hunting for prey in the vicinity of my cabin, and I have even managed to capture its movements from within the cabinâ€™s walls. Both the Short-eared and Long-eared owl exhibit remarkable grace in their flight patterns. While hunting, they remain close to the ground in search of prey, and they then soar through the fields with ease.

## Feeding

All three owls primarily hunts small mammals. The number of couples nesting is dependent on the number of mammals available.
