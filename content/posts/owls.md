Among the three owl species I have discussed on these pages, the Northern hawk-owl is a resident bird that I have only observed in proximity to my cabin in the mountains. The Short-eared owl, on the other hand, nests in the mountainous regions and migrates to the southern hemisphere during the winter months. Its close relative, the Long-eared owl, nests in the southern portion of Norway and refrains from migrating if it resides in the Oslo Fjord area.

All three owl species are widespread and common. However, despite their ubiquity, they can be challenging to observe. While all three species engage in diurnal hunting, the Short-eared owl and Long-eared owl are most active during sunrise and sunset. The Northern hawk-owl and Short-eared owl have yellow eyes, whereas the Long-eared owl has orange eyes.

## Northern hawk-owl

Over the past several weeks, from late October 2024 to approximately mid-March 2025, I have observed a distinct possibility of encountering three separate Northern hawk-owls in proximity to my mountain cabin. While I am uncertain whether this phenomenon is commonplace or exceptionally rare, the Northern hawk-owl is readily identifiable. Typically, these birds perch at the summit of tall trees, strategically positioned to observe their surroundings and locate potential prey. Notably, the behavior of these owls appears to be somewhat atypical. At one particular location, I have observed instances where the owl has permitted me to approach within a close proximity, approximately 4-5 meters. Conversely, at other encounters, the owl has responded by swiftly flying away when I come too close.

## Short-eared owl

During the spring season, the Short-eared owl migrates to the mountainous regions. During this migration, I have had the privilege of observing it in close proximity to my residence in Southern Norway. In 2025, I also had the opportunity to witness the Short-eared owl perched near my cabin within the mountains approximately five to six times. On occasion, I have observed it hunting for prey in the vicinity of my cabin, and I have even managed to capture its movements from within the cabinâ€™s walls. Both the Short-eared and Long-eared owl exhibit remarkable grace in their flight patterns. While hunting, they remain close to the ground in search of prey, and they then soar through the fields with ease.

## Long-eared owl

In the region of Southern Norway, my observations of the Long-eared owl have been confined to the vicinity of my residence. As the young owls leave their nests, they congregate in the trees at sunset, where they actively seek sustenance. This behavior presents an opportune moment for observing them. I dedicated five evenings to patiently awaiting their presence, and during two of those evenings, I was fortunate enough to witness them engaged in the pursuit of prey. Notably, both instances were characterized by favorable lighting conditions, resulting in sharp and close-up photographs.

## Feeding

All three owls primarily hunts small mammals. The number of couples nesting is dependent on the number of mammals available.
