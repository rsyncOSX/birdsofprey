The Northern hawk-owl is a resident bird that I have only observed in proximity to my cabin in the mountains.

All three owl species discussed on these pages are widespread and common. However, despite their ubiquity, they can be challenging to observe. While all three species engage in diurnal hunting, the Short-eared owl and Long-eared owl are most active during sunrise and sunset. The Northern hawk-owl and Short-eared owl have yellow eyes, whereas the Long-eared owl has orange eyes.

## 2024 - March 2025

Between mid-October 2024 and mid-March 2025, I have observed three distinct Northern hawk-owls in proximity to my mountain cabin. While I am uncertain whether this phenomenon is common or exceptionally rare, the Northern hawk-owl is readily identifiable. Typically, these birds perch at the summit of tall trees, strategically positioned to observe their surroundings and locate potential prey. Notably, the behavior of these owls appears to be somewhat atypical. At one particular location, I have observed instances where the owl has permitted me to approach within a close proximity, approximately 4-5 meters. Conversely, at other encounters, the owl has responded by swiftly flying away when I come too close.

## 2025 - from September

My initial observation of the Northern hawk-owl occurred in the early part of September 2025, following the summer of 2025. In contrast, my first observation of the hawk-owl was made in mid-October of the previous year.

## Feeding

All three owls primarily hunts small mammals. The number of couples nesting is dependent on the number of mammals available.
