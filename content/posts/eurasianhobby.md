*To be updated.*

The Eurasian hobby, a migratory bird, typically arrives in late spring and departs for Africa in late August, with the majority of its population departing by October. The Eurasian hobby has established neste near a lake in proximity to my residence. Its diet consists primarily of small birds and flying insects such as dragonflies. Observing the Eurasian hobby hunting and consuming dragonflies is an awe-inspiring experience. Their remarkable speed of movement makes it challenging to capture their movements on camera.
