I maintain two websites dedicated to bird photography: one focused on birds of prey, this site and the other on [other bird species](https://otherbirds.netlify.app). While I do not actively promote these sites, they primarily serve as personal reference tools for my bird photography endeavors. Over the past four to five years, I have dedicated myself exclusively to bird photography. Initially, I aimed to capture as many birds as possible, a common approach for novice bird photographers. However, in the past two years, I have adopted a more contemplative approach. In the future, I intend to prioritize capturing fewer birds and achieving better photographic quality.
